Our customers include some of the world\u0027s most recognizable consumer and industrial goods manufacturers. Their loyalty is testament to our commitment to that promise.

History Sonneborn\u0027s refinery in Petrolia, Pennsylvania, traces its heritage back to the late-1800s, while our facilities in the Netherlands have a full century of manufacturing and applications expertise. We pioneered the production of petrolatum for use in medical salves and ointments from the utilization of petroleum by-products previously considered unusable. The next major development came  as a result of the first World War. We became the first refiner of white oils in the United States, as offshore white oil was unavailable during those years. This marked a watershed in the future direction and growth of Sonneborn and its product offerings. Global presence Sonneborn is the global leader in the manufacture and supply of high-purity specialty hydrocarbons. Along the way, we\u0027ve improved on our original developments, utilizing our state-of-the-art refining and manufacturing processes to pioneer such innovations as stabilized and low-volatility plastics oils, super white petrolatums, high-pressure compressor lubricants and specialty food-grade wax blends. Most recently, we have introduced a 100% vegetable-based product line for personal care applications. We offer a similar product range in both Europe and North America, enabling us to more efficiently serve the needs of our global customers. Sonneborn is the world\u0027s only specialty hydrocarbon producer that offers this global reach expertise and depth of experience.

    "profile": "Turnkey contract manufacturing and custom formulation services for personal care products. House formulas available for private labeling. Turnkey contract manufacturing services to develop, compound, test, manufacture, and package a broad variety of liquid, lotion, cream, ointment, and gels adhering to cGMP and GLP protocols. Custom formulations are packaged in a wide variety of glass, plastic, or metal, tubes, jars, and bottles, or flexible film-form-and-seal single unit dose packets. Stock formulations available for private labeling include liquid protein supplements, vitamins and mineral nutritional supplements, skin care products, hair care products, toiletries, bath products and national brand equivalents. Types of internal liquid products include dietary supplements, medical foods, proteins, minerals, and vitamins. Company Description by Ambix Laboratories - Div. of Organics Corp. of America Ambix Laboratories provides unique and specialized formulating capabilities as a free, value-added service along with complete turnkey manufacturing, flexibility and responsiveness, customer-centric personalized service, stock product formulations, and minimums lower than many other mid-sized and large contract manufacturers. We feel that all of these traits distinguish us and makes us a desirable partner. Now in our 48th year of operation and possessing a management team with a combined 122 years of experience, Ambix Laboratories can boast of working for many well-known prestigious manufacturers, marketers, retailers, wholesalers and distributors over its lifetime, with a focus on niche products with margins rather than commodity products. Ambix is innovative, pioneering the nutrient dense, small dose, shelf stable, liquid collagen protein business 40 years ago, and continues to innovate within the liquid protein category today. Millions of people benefited from the tens-of-millions of  doses they consumed over this period and we are still counting today. In addition to liquid protein, we also custom formulate and manufacture shelf stable liquid vitamins, minerals, and botanical supplement products. Hair care, skin care, and other specialty products form the cornerstone of our personal care product offerings. Our operating philosophy of offering lower minimum order quantities makes us very appealing to many large, mid-sized, and smaller organizations that either do not want, or cannot meet, the minimums of larger, long-run, contract manufacturers. As a turnkey service provider, our customers can focus their resources and attention on marketing and sales activities to grow their business, rather than capital consuming, regulatory complex manufacturing operations and time consuming sourcing activities. Our FDA registered, NSF GMP Registered for Dietary Supplements, NSF Certified for Sport, Kosher certified and Organic certified facility is located in Totowa, New Jersey. We are right next to I-80 and only minutes away from New York City and the Port of New York and New Jersey, allowing us to easily serve domestic and international markets. Our Products are distributed under private label as well as stock labels throughout the U.S and Caribbean, parts of Euro Zone, Middle East, and Far East.",

Various products available include shampoos, conditioners, gels, lotions, creams, serums, wax, cleansers, moisturizers, scrubs, masks, toners, sprays, oils, bath salts, lip balms, lip glosses, stick diffusers, floor cleaners and glass cleaners. Aromatherapy, citronella and scented candles also offered. Contract manufacturing, research and development, quality control, regulatory and packaging services are provided. Suitable for department store, health specialty store, spa, resort and other applications. \r\nFounded in 1972 by George F. Dembow, Jr., ANR was launched with a product that came bubbling out of the ground: down to Earth mineral mud mask... This mud had been used for thousands of years by the Yavapai Indians in Arizona for its beautification and skin \u0027tightening\u0027 properties - George thought it would be fabulous to share this small miracle! A short time later, other natural products, such as a cactus moisturizer and shampoo, were introduced into the down to Earth line. In the mid-1970s, we expanded into manufacturing private label treatment cosmetics and toiletries for the department store trade. By the end of the decade, we were producing private label personal care products for 80% of department stores in the U.S. carrying private label programs. During the 1980s, we purchased \u0027living nail\u0027 nail hardener from Bendyne Ltd (sold in 2000), and we started servicing the hotel amenities industry, manufacturing small bottles of personal care products given to hotel guests. We also broadened into personal care contract manufacturing and private label candles. We purchased Crystal Candles Corporation and began producing its signature products: Lord Byron\u0027s smoker\u0027s odor eliminating candle, pet odor eliminating candle, and scentual pleasures aromatherapy candles. Since the mid-1990s, there\u0027s been a shift in the personal care industry from a private label emphasis to the need for innovative, cutting-edge technologies. Most beauty marketers now desire custom, unique formulations in a world full of \u0027me too\u0027 products. So we changed our focus and built up our research and development laboratory to accommodate this direction. Today Arizona Natural Resources, Inc. is proud to continue its family-owned tradition and is currently operated by George\u0027s son, George III, in Phoenix, Arizona. We are the leading innovative developer and contract manufacturer of skin and hair care products. Currently, we manufacture for many prestigious companies throughout the United States, including Fortune 500 companies, mass marketers, department stores, health specialty stores, direct marketers, spas, resorts, and others. For over 40 years, it has been our primary goal to be at the forefront of our field by following these simple principles: quality, service, value, honesty, and innovation.",

Yes, it\u0027s true that anyone can create an account and order from our website, but business buyers benefit even more! Paper Mart is proud to offer a multitude of discount opportunities and pricing options based on volume and pre-orders for businesses.

The distribution business was good, but founder and CEO Robin Bugenske would often get requests for his specialty lubricants in packages other than the standard offering of cartridges, pails, kegs and drums.  He made the keen business decision to purchase his own filling equipment and thus created a better way to market his products.  SPECIALTY LUBRICANTS CORP. quickly became a leader in custom packaged private label greases and oils, servicing industrial, automotive aftermarket and OEM customers.\nIt wasn’t long before SPECIALTY LUBRICANTS CORP. was filling and packaging products other than greases and oils.  Products such as adhesives, paints and cleaners were quickly filling up space in our production schedules.  In order to better serve these markets, we created SLC CUSTOM PACKAGING, a division focused specifically on contract filling.  Our manufacturing capabilities have since expanded in both size and scope with the addition of a cGMP room.  This area is dedicated to filling and packaging health and beauty aids such as hair care, skin care, cosmetic and other consumer packaged goods.\n\nAfter three decades of steady growth we are proud to call ourselves experts in contract packaging.  We have an endless array of resources at our disposal, and are well equipped to meet the ever-changing needs of our customers.",

Each one of the products was developed with no corners cut to save cost, no inexpensive fillers to water them down, and only the most effective active ingredients to create products that work and support healthy, age-defying skin. We continue this approach with our collection today because we believe healthy skin is beautiful skin. We’ve taken the guesswork out of skincare and created the formulas you would create for yourself.\nOur innovative and complex skincare formulas are made from consciously sourced ingredients and lovingly prepared in small batches. We produce our entire collection in our dedicated private lab, so there is no risk of cross-contamination with irritants contained in another company’s formulations. Every single ingredient is carefully curated to feed the skin and deliver results.\n\nWHAT WE DO NOT USE What we do not put in our products is just as important as the wonderful ingredients we do use.",

    "profile": "In 1996, makeup artist and cosmetic industry veteran, Mary Swaab founded Colorlab in answer to her self-imposed challenge: how to get the perfect lipstick for her clients. In the past, Swaab used the technique that makeup artists had always used, combining a variety of lipsticks to come up with just the right color and texture. For clients, replicating this process at home was cumbersome, inexact and was often hindered by the discontinuation of one of their lipsticks. Swaab knew there was a niche to be filled.\n Swaab developed a patented system that allowed makeup artists to create custom lipsticks in any color and texture at the cosmetics counter. Colorlab was born. The interactive lipstick making process amazed and delighted clients. Colorlab was an instant success.\n Colorlab quickly earned its reputation as a leader and trendsetter in the industry. Committed to both the process of custom blending and excep- tional ingredients, Colorlab continued to innovate. Lipstick led to lip gloss, foundation and then to a full range of custom blend cosmetics as well as a sought-after collection of retail custom blend cosmetic-kits.\n Makeup artists, beauty editors and consumers were quick to embrace this new opportunity for expression. Colorlab gained recognition in Vogue, InStyle, Mademoiselle and Seventeen magazines.\n \n Colorlab Private Label can be experienced in real time at fine salons/spas and select department stores.",
